:summary: We need an intermediate role between a technical manager and a content manager.

Yes, we have the best open-source professional CMS of the galaxy - and beyond
- out here. With the age and of course the help of the framework developers
and lots of others, Plone gained lots of functionnalities. A huge set of
options to tweak a Plone site such it is your Plone site are now available
through the Plone content panel.

As Plone professional, I have to train site managers for customers. And most
of the new site managers I have to train are not IT professional. Most are
marketing or communication executives. And when most of them have good
functional skills and know what they want to do with their Plone site and how
to provide information and services to visitors, it is somehow dificult to
teach them about HTML/CSS filtering, Javascript adds, SMTP connection, Plone
extension (un, re)installation, ZMI access and other potentially harmful
control panels.

As a consequence, I sometimes need to hide potentially harmful control panels
to such non technical managers on these sites.

I'm sure lots of you, dear Plone service providers who read these lines, are
often facing such situations. That's why I think that there's a place for a
new OTB role in Plone. I'll call it "webmaster" at the moment.

Such user could do most things a Manager is enabled to do through the Plone
except accessing those harmful control panels.

To make short, a webmaster would have all Manager permissions granted except
"View management screens". Of course, from there it's fairly easy to hide the
links to ZMI, Extensions management and others from the control panels, but it
does not solve lots of other things that requires some tweaks in the control
panels.

Any though ?
